# dotfiles
A place to keep track of my dotfiles.

### quick setup
```
chomd +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh
```
This will create symbolic links between the dotfiles and their proper locations.

Use `./setup.sh clean` to remove all created links.

things to install first:
i3 ( window manager )
dunst ( notification deamon )
rofi ( better than dmenu )
