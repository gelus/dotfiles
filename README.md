# dotfiles
A place to keep track of my dotfiles.

### quick setup
```
chomd +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh
```
This will create symbolic links between the dotfiles and their proper locations.

Use `./setup.sh clean` to remove all created links.

things to install first:
 - i3gaps (or just i3, will need to take gap settings out of i3/config )( window manager )
 - i3blocks ( i3 status bar )
 - dunst ( notification deamon )
 - rofi ( better than dmenu )
